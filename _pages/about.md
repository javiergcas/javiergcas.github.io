I am originally from [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain). It is also in Madrid where I pursued a B.S./M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Universidad Politecnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es). Following graduation, I joined [Hewlett-Packard Labs](https://hpl.hp.com) in [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol), UK as a research assistant developing electronic-commerce automation technologies. After a year in Bristol, I moved back to Madrid to join the Hewlett-Packard Consulting department.

In the early 2000s, I decided it was time for a change. I was very interested in finding ways to apply my engineering skills to solving biological problems. After many standarized tests and a few unsucessful applications, in 2004, I was awarded a [Fulbright Fellowship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) to pursue a Ph.D. in [Biomedical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BME) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) in West Lafayette, IN. It is at Purdue where I had my first encounter with fMRI. You can read much more about that below, but for now suffice to say that I worked on several language-related fMRI studies under the mentorship of [Prof. Thomas Talavage](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=3304).

After five wonderful years at Purdue (which brings us to December, 2009) I moved to the D.C. area to join the [Section on Functional Imaging Methods (SFIM)](https://fim.nimh.nih.gov/) at the [National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/) in Bethesda, MD as a Post-Doctoral Fellow. In 2014, I became a Staff Scientist within the Section, which has been (and still is) my research home for a decade now.
