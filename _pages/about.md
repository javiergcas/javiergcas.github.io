Short Story
===========

I am originally from [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain). It is also in Madrid where I pursued a B.S./M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Universidad Politecnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es). Following graduation, I joined [Hewlett-Packard Labs](https://hpl.hp.com) in [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol), UK as a research assistant developing electronic-commerce automation technologies (check X and Y for additional details). After a year in Bristol, I moved back to Madrid to join the Hewlett-Packard Consulting department.

In the early 2000s, I decided it was time for a change. I was very interested in finding ways to apply my engineering skills to solving biological problems. After many standarized tests and a few unsucessful applications, in 2004, I was awarded a [Fulbright Fellowship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) to pursue a Ph.D. in [Biomedical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BME) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) in West Lafayette, IN. It is at Purdue where I had my first encounter with fMRI. You can read much more about that below, but for now suffice to say that I worked on several language-related fMRI studies under the mentorship of [Prof. Thomas Talavage](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=3304).

After five wonderful years at Purdue (which brings us to December, 2009) I moved to the D.C. area to join the [Section on Functional Imaging Methods (SFIM)](https://fim.nimh.nih.gov/) at the [National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/) in Bethesda, MD as a Post-Doctoral Fellow. In 2014, I became a Staff Scientist within the Section, which has been (and still is) my research home for a decade now. 

The really long story....
=========================

Work in progress...
I am originally from [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain), a charming city right in the middle of the Iberian Peninsula. It is in Madrid where I attended college and was awarded a B.S. and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering by [Universidad Politecnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es). Right after graduation, I moved to the city of [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol) in the UK, where I spent a year as a research engineer working for [Hewlett-Packard Labs](https://hpl.hp.com) in the development of algorithms for e-commerce applications. That was followed by several more years working as an IT consultant for Hewlett Packard (HP) back in Madrid. It was during this second term as a Madrileño, that the idea of switching careers started to take shape in my mind. Although Hewlett Packard truly felt like home to me, I knew something was missing. Since my college years, I always had an interest on how engineering skills could be applied to the resolution of biomedical problems. Hewlett Packard was not necessarily the best place to develop such interests at the time. If I wanted to actively contribute to the resolution of biomedical challenges, I couldn't just switch jobs, I had to re-invent myself professionally. Next stop in life, graduate school.

I arrived to [West Lafayette](https://www.westlafayette.in.gov/), Indiana on a hot day in early August 2004 with two suitcases full of renewed energy, and a few clothes. After a year of standardized tests, writing statements of purpose and countless applications I was awarded a [Fulbright Fellowship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) to pursue a Ph.D. in [Biomedical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BME) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu). Soon after arriving to Purdue, I joined the lab of Prof. [Thomas Talavage](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~tmt/), one of the few faculty at the time with expertise in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and auditory neuroscience. These two topics had repeatedly caught my attention while researching areas of interest for my Ph.D. applications. In fact, since I first heard about [fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging), I became particularly intrigued about how this relatively young functional neuroimaging disciple was able to open a window into the inner workings of the functioning human brain without having to poke a single needle into the head. As an engineer, I needed to learn more details about how such a "cool" technology operated.

I first met Prof. Talavage at his former north-east corner office in the third floor of the EE building during my freshmen year. After a brief conversation, he invited to stop by at lab meetings and scanning sessions so that I could get a better understanding of the research his group was conducting. A few attendances were sufficient to convince me that I could find countless interesting research topics in his lab. Over the five and half years that I spent at Purdue I worked on projects in areas such as the [semantic representation of action verbs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093934X07002611), uncovering neuronal differences in speech perception between normal hearing subject and cochlear implant users, or [developing reliable experimental paradigms to study speech perception with fMRI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191001284X). Project after project I got more and more interested in the brain. I also came to realize how complex fMRI was; and how much more I needed to learn about the technology itself. If I wanted to generate novel insightful neuroscientific knowledge (with a potential clinical value) using fMRI, I first needed to deepen my understanding of the technology itself. That reasoning (and several emails and phone conversations) is what brought me to the [Section on Functional Imaging Methods (SFIM)](https://fim.nimh.nih.gov/) at the [National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/) in Bethesda, Maryland for the first time in the summer of 2007. That was followed by a second summer in 2008, and then, after graduation, by several more years as a post-doc first and now as a staff scientist. During my time at the NIH, I have working on improving the quality of fMRI data via optimization of acquisition protocols and contributing to the development of novel multi-echo analytical methods. I have also spent considerable time looking at hemodynamic variability across the brain and devising methods that can account for it in order to detect the true extent of brain activity that accompanies task performance. Another big interest of mine over the years have been the development of realtime fMRI mehtods and their applicability as alternative clinical interventions. Over the last five years, I have focused most of my research efforts in brain connectomics, and more particularly in understanding what drives fMRI functional connectivity during resting-state, and how unconstrained thoughts and covert ongoing experience affect dynamical estiamtes of functional connectivity. I have also recently developed (as everybody else) a strong interest in machine learning and deep learning, and in devising ways to use these advanced techologies to extract even more meaningful information from fMRI data.

Even after all these years, I am still excited to arrive to my office and explore yet another set of fMRI scans. They procure me, not only with an enjoyable challenge (and those who know me will tell you I like those), but with an opportunity to learn something new both about the brain and the fMRI signal itself. If you want to learn more about the research I have conducted here at the NIMH, please stop by the Research wing of this site.

So, this is mostly my story, an engineer turned neuroscientist with the dream of helping resolve mental health riddles. Of course, there are some omissions, but the key elements of the plot have all been laid in front of your eyes. I know that, despite many years at the bench (or more accurately the computer screen), this is just the beginning of the journey. I cannot finalize this post though, without mentioning at least three other people that have shaped who I am today as a scientist. Those are, in no specific order, Dr. Leslie Geddes (former mentor at Purdue University), Dr. David Kemmerer (former mentor at Purdue University) and Dr. Peter Bandettini (current mentor at NIMH). They each have taught me different aspects of what being a scientist means. Special thanks go to Dr. Geddes, who unfortunately is no longer with us. He not only explained me important scientific concepts, equations, and models. He showed me what a true scientist is. I can only hope but to make him proud with my work one day.

As you know now (after reading this not so short post), this was not a well-delineated travel plan, yet it has presented itself as a truly fun professional voyage. Let's hope it will continue that way.
