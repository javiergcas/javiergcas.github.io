I am an engineer turned scientist, driven by a passion for exploring how emerging technologies and big data can lead to discoveries and meaningful societal impact. My career bridges <b>AI, computational modeling, and the life sciences</b>. From developing semantic web technologies at HP Labs to applying machine learning and deep learning to complex biological systems during my Ph.D. at Purdue University and later at the NIH, I have consistently pursued data-driven innovation to address real-world challenges.

<b>Here is a chronological perspective of my professional career so far...</b>

{: .text-justify}
I was born in [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain). It was in Madrid too that I pursued a B.S./M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Universidad Politecnica](https://www.upm.es). Following graduation, I joined [Hewlett-Packard Labs](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/hewlett-packard-labs.html) in [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol), UK as a research assistant developing electronic-commerce automation technologies. While in Bristol I published two Technical Reports with HP that you can find [here](https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/ddis/iswc_archive/iswc/pps/web/swws-zip/program/full/paper52a.pdf) and [here](https://shiftleft.com/mirrors/www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2001/HPL-2001-265.pdf). After a year in Bristol, I moved back to Madrid to join the Hewlett-Packard Consulting department, where I worked first as a technical consultant and later as a project manager.

In the early 2000s, I decided it was time for a change. I was very interested in finding ways to apply my engineering skills to solving biological problems. After many standarized tests and a few unsucessful applications, in 2004, I was awarded a [Fulbright Fellowship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) to pursue a Ph.D. in [Biomedical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BME) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) in West Lafayette, IN. It is at Purdue where I had my first encounter with [fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging) thanks to [Prof. Thomas Talavage](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/biomedical-engineering/people.html). In his lab, and through collaborations with [Prof. David Kemmerer](https://www.purdue.edu/hhs/slhs/directory/faculty/kemmerer_david.html), I conducted research in auditory neuroscience and language representation.

After five wonderful years at Purdue (which brings us to December, 2009) I moved to the D.C. area to join the [Section on Functional Imaging Methods (SFIM)](https://fim.nimh.nih.gov/) at the [National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/) in Bethesda, MD as a Post-Doctoral Fellow. In 2014, I became a Staff Scientist within the Section, which has been (and still is) my research home for over a decade now. Later in 2021, I became Senior Associate Scientist. At the SFIM, I work on a veriety of projects aimed at improving the quality of fMRI signals and advancing our understanding of the functional organization of the human brain. Topics to which I currently devote a significant amount of time include resting state fMRI, time-varying functional connectivity, realtime fMRI and understanding the role of intrinsic cognition in shaping functional connectivity. You can find additional details about my research agenda [here](https://javiergcas.github.io/research/). Also, in this website you can find a list of all [my publications](https://javiergcas.github.io/publications/) with links to PDFs, as well as data and [talks](https://javiergcas.github.io/talks/) when those are available.
