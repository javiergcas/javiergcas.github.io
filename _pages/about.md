I am originally from [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain). It is also in Madrid where I pursued a B.S./M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Universidad Politecnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es). Following graduation, I joined [Hewlett-Packard Labs](https://hpl.hp.com) in [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol), UK as a research assistant developing electronic-commerce automation technologies (check X and Y for additional details). After a year in Bristol, I moved back to Madrid to join the Hewlett-Packard Consulting department.

In the early 2000s, I decided it was time for a change. I was very interested in finding ways to apply my engineering skills to solving biological problems. After many standarized tests and a few unsucessful applications, in 2004, I was awarded a [Fulbright Fellowship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) to pursue a Ph.D. in [Biomedical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BME) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) in West Lafayette, IN. It is at Purdue where I had my first encounter with fMRI. You can read much more about that below, but for now suffice to say that I worked on several language-related fMRI studies under the mentorship of [Prof. Thomas Talavage](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=3304).

After five wonderful years at Purdue (which brings us to December, 2009) I moved to the D.C. area to join the [Section on Functional Imaging Methods (SFIM)](https://fim.nimh.nih.gov/) at the [National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/) in Bethesda, MD as a Post-Doctoral Fellow. In 2014, I became a Staff Scientist within the Section, which has been (and still is) my research home for a decade now. 

## About my research

Prior to my Ph.D. I did some research at Hewlett Packar Labs in Bristol, UK. That work mostly focused on the development of algorithms for e-commerce applications. The outcome of that work can be found in two conference proceedings:

* 2001: [Description Logics for matchmaking of services](https://javiergcas.github.io/publication/2001-01-01-Description-logics-for-matchmaking-of-services)
* 2001: [A semantic web approach to service description for matchmaking of services](https://javiergcas.github.io/publication/2001-01-01-A-semantic-web-approach-to-service-description-for-matchmaking-of-services)

This was followed by my graduate work at Purdue University, which has two main components. One is purely methodological and includes studies of fMRI paradigm reliability and the effects of acoustic noise in fMRI. The second component of my work was more neuroscience oriented and looked at different aspects of speech perception and language representations in the brain.
