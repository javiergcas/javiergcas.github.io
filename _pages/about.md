A bit about me
======

I was born and raised in [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain). It is also in Madrid where I pursued a B.S./M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Universidad Politecnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es). Following graduation, I joined [Hewlett-Packard Labs](https://hpl.hp.com) in [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol), UK as a research assistant developing electronic-commerce automation technologies (check X and Y for additional details). After a year in Bristol, I moved back to Madrid to join the Hwewlett-Packard Consulting department. It was my time at these two different HP organizations that allowed me to develop key skills in the areas of computer science, data analytics, and project management. 

In the early 2000s, I decided it was time for a change. I was very interested in finding ways to apply my engineering skills to solving biological problems. After many standarized tests and a few unsucessful applications, in 2004, I was awarded a [Fulbright Fellowship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) to pursue a Ph.D. in [Biomedical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BME) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) in West Lafayette, IN. It is at Purdue where I had my first encounter with fMRI. You can read much more about that below, but for now suffice to say that I worked on several language-related fMRI studies under the mentorship of [Prof. Thomas Talavage](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=3304).

After five wonderful years at Purdue (which brings us to December, 2009) I moved to the D.C. area to join the [Section on Functional Imaging Methods (SFIM)](https://fim.nimh.nih.gov/) at the [National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/) in Bethesda, MD as a Post-Doctoral Fellow. In 2014, I became a Staff Scientist within the Section, which has been (and still is) my research home for a decade now.
