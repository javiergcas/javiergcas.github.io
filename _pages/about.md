I was born in [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain). It was in Madrid too that I pursued a B.S./M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Universidad Politecnica](https://www.upm.es). Following graduation, I joined [Hewlett-Packard Labs](https://hpl.hp.com) in [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol), UK as a research assistant developing electronic-commerce automation technologies. After a year in Bristol, I moved back to Madrid to join the Hewlett-Packard Consulting department.

In the early 2000s, I decided it was time for a change. I was very interested in finding ways to apply my engineering skills to solving biological problems. After many standarized tests and a few unsucessful applications, in 2004, I was awarded a [Fulbright Fellowship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) to pursue a Ph.D. in [Biomedical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BME) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) in West Lafayette, IN. It is at Purdue where I had my first encounter with [fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging) thanks to [Prof. Thomas Talavage](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/biomedical-engineering/people.html). In his lab, and through collaborations with [Prof. David Kemmerer](https://www.purdue.edu/hhs/slhs/directory/faculty/kemmerer_david.html), I conducted research in auditory neuroscience and language representation.

After five wonderful years at Purdue (which brings us to December, 2009) I moved to the D.C. area to join the [Section on Functional Imaging Methods (SFIM)](https://fim.nimh.nih.gov/) at the [National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/) in Bethesda, MD as a Post-Doctoral Fellow. In 2014, I became a Staff Scientist within the Section, which has been (and still is) my research home for over a decade now. At the SFIM, I work on a veriety of projects aimed at improving the quality of fMRI signals and advancing our understanding of the functional organization of the human brain. Topics to which I currently devote a significant amount time include resting state fMRI, time-varying functional connectivity, realtime fMRI and understanding the role of intrinsic cognition on functional connectivity.
