As an engineer entering the world of neuroscience, I initially struggled with the uncertainty and high levels of noise inherent in neuroscience researchâ€”particularly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging">fucntional MRI</a> (fMRI). Early on, I decided to dedicate part of my time to better understanding the properties of the signals measured with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-oxygenation-level%E2%80%93dependent_imaging">BOLD fMRI</a>, studying their reliability, and optimizing scanning parameters. Some of these studies are highlighted below.
