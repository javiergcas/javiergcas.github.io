Most of my research—whether [methodological](analytical) or [cognitive](cogneuro)—relies on neuroimaging data collected from healthy participants. That said, I am also deeply interested in shedding light on what happens in the brains of individuals affected by conditions such as epilepsy, chronic pain, or dementia, and in exploring how we can help them cope with the most debilitating symptoms associated with these diagnoses.

Over the years, I have provided—and continue to provide—technical expertise in experimental design, advanced analytical methods, and neuroimaging data interpretation to clinical collaborators both within and outside the NIH. Below is a list of some publications that have resulted from these collaborations:
