Methods are fun, but they are more fun and become useful when they allow you to answer some unkownn, in this case some unkown about the brain. In this section you will find a brief discussion of three cognitive neuroscience questions of great interest to me:

### Behavioral Processes behind Time-varying Functional Connectivity

<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2014.00138/full"><img align="right" src="https://javiergcas.github.io/files/research/tvfc/research_tvfc_img01.png" width="317 px" style="padding: 10px"></a>

[Functional connectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resting_state_fMRI#Functional), as measured with [BOLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-oxygen-level-dependent_imaging) fMRI, exhibits dynamic behavior at the scale of seconds, with rich spatiotemporal structure both during [resting state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resting_state_fMRI) and task scans. What does such dynamicity reflects? To what extent do aberrant patterns of time-varying functional connectivity signal pathology? Those are all open questions. In early studies, we focused on characterizing the [sptio-tempotal structure of this dynamic phenomena](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2014.00138/full) during the resting state. We were able to show that most stable connections correspond primarily to inter-hemispheric connections between left/right homologous regions; while most variable connections correspond to inter-hemispheric, across-network connections between non-homologous regions in occipital and frontal cortex (e.g., those subserving higher-order cognitive functions). We also demonstrated that well established resting state networks disintegrate on many occasions during a single scan, questioning the interpretability of such networks.

In addition to studying the region-to-region spatiotemporal structure of time-varying functional connectivity during resting state, I have also conducted experiments aimed at validating the interpretability of whole-brain dynamic functional connectivity patterns as markers of on-going cognition. In particular, using multi-task scans and unsupervised machine learning we demonstrated a direct [link between short-term (tens of seconds long) whole-brain functional connectivity patterns and on-going mental processing](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/28/8762.short) at the single-subject level. More recenlty, we have applied the [same methodology to resting-state data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811919307207) and demonstrated that it is possible to infer the cognitive nature of a subjects' mental activity at discrete scan segments on the basis of time-varying connectivity and hemodynamic deconvolution.

### Conscious correlates of spontaneous brain activity

Brain activity is not always linked to concurrent external environmental demands or stimuli. In fact, complex dynamical patterns of activity—-and their conscious manifestation as an incessant stream of thoughts, emotions and sensations—-constantly unfold in otherwise apparently idle individuals. Despite their ubiquity and core role for survival, the neurobiological correlates of such inner experiences remain largely unknown. This scientific gap is mostly due to how difficult is to objectively characterize something that is so inherently covert and personal. Nonetheless, recent developments in functional neuroimaging, idiographic/experiential science and artificial intelligence (AI) provide a unique opportunity to build scientific models of the neurobiological, behavioral and clinical correlates of free thought. We are currently in the process of conducting new experiments that combine real-time fMRI, experiential methods and machine learning to learn more about the neural correlates of free thought.

### Localization and Distributed Functions

The majority of task-based fMRI studies focus exclusively on interpreting positive BOLD deflections that tightly follow external stimuli or task demands (i.e., those sustained as long as the experimental intervention is in place). Although exclusive focus on positively sustained BOLD responses have proven successful to uncover the neuronal correlates of a myriad of human behaviors; unfortunately, this practice results in true neuronal responses continuously passing undetected in fMRI. As such, current conceptualizations of brain function based on task-based fMRI research are incomplete.

In the past, we have shown how non-conventional BOLD responses, namely negative signal deflections accompanying task performance (negative sustained BOLD) and phasic responses that occur at the onset/offset of experimental events, can be modulated by cognitive demands. Using data with approximately six times higher signal-to-noise ratio than conventional fMRI, we were able to demonstrate that BOLD signal changes correlated with experimental task-timing occur in over 95% of the brain even for the simplest of tasks. These results not only highlight the inadequacy of current dichotomical interpretational models (active/inactive), but also challenge long accepted localizationist views of brain function demonstrating how non-canonical responses ought to be discussed if one is to acquire a full understanding of brain function. Important questions remain such as how to differentiate essential (i.e., signaling regions that are indispensable to accomplish a given task) from accessory activations, or how to report and interpret whole-brain activity maps.
