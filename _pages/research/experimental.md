As an engineer entering the world of neuroscience, I initially struggled with the uncertainty and high levels of noise inherent in neuroscience research—particularly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging">fucntional MRI</a> (fMRI). Early on, I decided to dedicate part of my time to better understanding the properties of the signals measured with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-oxygenation-level%E2%80%93dependent_imaging">BOLD fMRI</a>, studying their reliability, and optimizing scanning parameters. Some of these studies are highlighted below.

### Exploring the Quality of fMRI Data

This line of work explores innovative ways to extract meaningful structure from high-dimensional fMRI data. Using tools from graph theory, statistical learning, and information theory, we have been able to uncover hidden patterns of connectivity that inform our understanding of cognitive and affective brain function. These efforts also include developing and validating open-source software tools for robust and reproducible neuroimaging data analysis.

In addition to studying the region-to-region spatiotemporal structure of time-varying functional connectivity during resting state, I have also conducted experiments aimed at validating the interpretability of whole-brain dynamic functional connectivity patterns as markers of on-going cognition. In particular, using multi-task scans and unsupervised machine learning we demonstrated a direct [link between short-term (tens of seconds long) whole-brain functional connectivity patterns and on-going mental processing](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/28/8762.short) at the single-subject level. More recenlty, we have applied the [same methodology to resting-state data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811919307207) and demonstrated that it is possible to infer the cognitive nature of a subjects' mental activity at discrete scan segments on the basis of time-varying connectivity and hemodynamic deconvolution.
