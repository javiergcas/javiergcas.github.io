## Current Research

### Prior research work

Graduate work at Purdue University
: {: .text-justify}My graduate research had two main components: one was purely methodological and included research on fMRI paradigm reliability and the effects of acoustic noise in fMRI; the second was more neuroscience oriented and focused on different aspects of speech perception and language representations in the brain.

* fMRI Methology:

  ## About my research

Prior to my Ph.D. I did some research at Hewlett Packar Labs in Bristol, UK. That work mostly focused on the development of algorithms for e-commerce applications. The outcome of that work can be found in two conference proceedings:

* 2001: [Description Logics for matchmaking of services](https://javiergcas.github.io/publication/2001-01-01-Description-logics-for-matchmaking-of-services)
* 2001: [A semantic web approach to service description for matchmaking of services](https://javiergcas.github.io/publication/2001-01-01-A-semantic-web-approach-to-service-description-for-matchmaking-of-services)
