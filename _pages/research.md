### What are the neuronal drivers of time-varying functional connectivity?


### What are the neuronal correlates of self-driven thoughts and inner experiences?

{: .text-justify}
Brain activity is not always linked to concurrent external environmental demands or stimuli. In fact, complex dynamical patterns of activity—and their conscious manifestation as an incessant stream of thoughts, emotions and sensations—constantly unfold in otherwise apparently idle individuals. Despite their ubiquity and core role for survival, the neurobiological correlates of such inner experiences remain largely unknown. This scientific gap is mostly due to how difficult is to objectively characterize something that is so inherently covert and personal. Nonetheless, recent developments in functional neuroimaging, idiographic/experiential science and artificial intelligence (AI) provide a unique opportunity to build scientific models of the neurobiological, behavioral and clinical correlates of free thought. For example, real-time resting-state fMRI can non-invasively live-stream video of how brain regions activate and interact as subjects quietly rest and let their mind wander freely. Experiential scientific methods, such as descriptive experience sampling, can provide an objective, unbiased characterization of the form and content of inner experience. Finally, AI algorithms can help us efficiently explore the richness of these data with minimal a-priori assumptions, and, in that manner, help us discover meaningful complex relationships among neuronal activity, inner experience, people’s perception and interaction with the external world, and ultimately their mental health.

# Prior Research

### Graduate work at Purdue University

My graduate research had two main components: one was purely methodological and included research on fMRI paradigm reliability and the effects of acoustic noise in fMRI; the second was more neuroscience oriented and focused on different aspects of speech perception and language representations in the brain.

The most methodologically oriented work can be found in the following publications:

  * 2011: [Assesment of tempora state-dependent interactions between auditory fMRI responses to desided and undesired acoustic sources](https://javiergcas.github.io/publication/2011-01-01-Assessment-of-temporal-state-dependent-interactions-between-auditory-fMRI-r)
  * 2012: [Hemodynamic Imaging: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging](https://javiergcas.github.io/publication/2012-01-01-Hemodynamic-Imaging%3A-Functional-Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging)
  * 2014: [Auditory neuroimaing with fMRI and PET](https://javiergcas.github.io/publication/2014-01-01-Auditory-neuroimaging-with-fMRI-and-PET)

As for the speech and language representation work, please check those:

#### Research work at Hewlett-Parckard Labs

Prior to my Ph.D. I did some research at Hewlett Packar Labs in Bristol, UK. That work mostly focused on the development of algorithms for e-commerce applications. The outcome of that work can be found in two conference proceedings:

* 2001: [Description Logics for matchmaking of services](https://javiergcas.github.io/publication/2001-01-01-Description-logics-for-matchmaking-of-services)
* 2001: [A semantic web approach to service description for matchmaking of services](https://javiergcas.github.io/publication/2001-01-01-A-semantic-web-approach-to-service-description-for-matchmaking-of-services)
