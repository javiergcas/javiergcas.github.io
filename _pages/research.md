The brain works in mysterious ways, and my research aims to uncover—or at least help explain—some of these mysteries through the combination of state-of-the-art neuroimaging, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced computational modeling.

{: .text-justify}
Over the past 20 years, I’ve contributed to more than 60 research projects spanning a wide range of topics—from technical questions like how to optimize scanning parameters to improve data fidelity, to complex biological questions such as how spontaneous brain activity relates to conscious experience.

There are many ways to organize such a broad research portfolio, but for the purpose of this website, I’ve divided the “Research” section into four main areas:

|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Experimental Methods Research    | Analytical Methods Research   |
| Cognitive Neuroscience Research  | Clinical Research             |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|


Click on any of the sections above—or use the menu to your left—to explore the questions I’ve sought to answer in each area and how I (with the invaluable help of many colleagues) went about it. I hope you find it engaging, and maybe even learn something new along the way.
