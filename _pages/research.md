## Current Research

## Prior Research

Graduate work at Purdue University
: My graduate research had two main components: one was purely methodological and included research on fMRI paradigm reliability and the effects of acoustic noise in fMRI; the second was more neuroscience oriented and focused on different aspects of speech perception and language representations in the brain.
