excerpt: 'Matchmaking is an important aspect of E-Commerce interactions. The current trend in B2B E-Commerce automation is towards complex interactions for service provision. In this context, matchmaking services require rich and flexible metadata as well as matching algorithms. The Semantic Web initiative at W3C is gaining momentum and generating suitable technologies and tools to cover both the metadata and the algorithmic aspects. In this paper we describe our experience in building a matchmaking prototype. We choose to base our prototype on a Description Logic (DL) reasoner, operating on service descriptions in DAML+ OIL. We report on our investigation of DAML+ OIL to express service descriptions and on our experience on existing DL reasoners, in particular assessing RACER and FACT.'
