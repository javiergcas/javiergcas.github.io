excerpt: 'The first two decades of brain research using fMRI have been dominated by studies that measure signal changes in response to a presented task. A rapidly increasing number of studies are showing that consistent activation maps appear by assessment of signal correlations during time periods in which the subjects were not directed to perform any specific task (i.e. “resting state correlations”). Even though neural interactions can happen on much shorter time scales, most “resting state” studies assess these temporal correlations over a period of about 5 to 10 min. Here we investigate how these temporal correlations change on a shorter time scale. We examine changes in brain correlations to the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) across a 10‐minute scan. We show: (1) fMRI correlations fluctuate over time, (2) these fluctuations can be periodic, and (3) correlations between the PCC and other brain regions fluctuate at …'
