excerpt: ' This work introduces a novel framework for the deconvolution of the BOLD signal in multi-echo functional MRI (ME-fMRI) data: Multi-echo Sparse Paradigm Free Mapping (ME-SPFM). Building upon a physical model of the ME-fMRI signal and using a sparsity-promoting regularized least squares estimator, this algorithm obtains time-varying maps of the changes in the transverse relaxation rate () and the net magnetization () of the signal at the subject level without prior knowledge of the timing of the individual BOLD events. Our results with experimental data demonstrate that the maps of  changes obtained with ME-SPFM at the times of the stimulus trials closely resemble the maps obtained with standard model-based methods that are aware of the onsets and durations of the experimental events, and considerably improves the accuracy of the deconvolution compared with the SPFM algorithm …'
