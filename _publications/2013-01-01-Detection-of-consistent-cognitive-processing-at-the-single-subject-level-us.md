excerpt: 'Recent studies have demonstrated that resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity patterns are dynamic in nature; and that significant changes in the strength and distribution of connections occur as scanning progresses [1, 2, 3]. Consequently, connectivity patterns obtained using one portion of a scan (eg, first 2 mins) may differ greatly from patterns observed using the rest of the data or when the whole scan is used at once. In particular, there are three main observations reported with respect to rs-fMRI connectivity dynamics so far:(1) rs-fMRI connectivity changes substantially in the scale of seconds to minutes [1];(2) changes occur both during awake and anesthetized conditions [3]; and (3) a certain level of recurrent structure can be found, with a limited set of connectivity configurations (functional connectivity states; FC states) being stable for short durations, and recurring in time and across subjects [4]. These observations pose important questions regarding the biological significance and interpretation of rs-fMRI dynamics at these shorter time scales.Of particular interest is the potential relationship between FC states and cognition. It has been previously shown that a classifier could differentiate between four different cognitive states on the basis of whole-brain connectivity [5]. Accuracies as high as 80% were reported for time windows as short at 60 s. Nonetheless, the methods described in that work are not suitable for evaluating the relationship between FC and cognitive state in rs-fMRI due to the need for:(1) a training dataset,(2) a-priori information about informative connections, and a (3) well-defined/limited search domain of cognitive states …'
