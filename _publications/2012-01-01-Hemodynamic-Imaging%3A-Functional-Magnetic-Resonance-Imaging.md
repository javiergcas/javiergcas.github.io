excerpt: ' In the last few decades, structural and functional imaging methods have revolutionized cognitive neuroscience, providing a window into the functional organization and behavior of the human brain (review: Raichle, 2009). Neuroscientists no longer need rely on postmortem analysis of cortical lesions and their correlation to in vivo deficits (see Clarke and Morosan, Chapter 2) or perform invasive electrocorticographic recordings to study neural correlates of cognition (see Howard, Nourski, and Brugge, Chapter 3). Rather, detailed anatomical images, often acquired via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be combined with functional information from electroencephalography (EEG) (see Alain and Winkler, Chapter 4), magnetoencephalography (MEG) (see Nagarajan, Gabriel, and Herman, Chapter 5), positron emission tomography (PET), or functional MRI (fMRI) to obtain dynamic pictures of brain function …'
