excerpt: ' The chapter uses electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence to explore neural bases of telicity/atelicity computation. We focus on understanding how general language processing resources (e.g., working memory), as well as language-specific ones contribute to online computation of event structure from its distinctive features in spoken (English) and sign languages (e.g., American Sign Language, Croatian Sign Language).'
