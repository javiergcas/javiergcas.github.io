excerpt: 'Given the dynamic nature of the human brain, there has been an increasing interest in investigating short-term temporal changes in functional connectivity, also known as dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), i.e., the time-varying inter-regional statistical dependence of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal within the constraints of a single scan. Numerous methodologies have been proposed to characterize dFC during rest and task, but few studies have compared them in terms of their efficacy to capture behavioral and clinically relevant dynamics. This is mostly due to lack of a well-defined ground truth, especially for rest scans. In this study, with a multitask dataset (rest, memory, video, and math) serving as ground truth, we investigated the efficacy of several dFC estimation techniques at capturing cognitively relevant dFC modulation induced by external tasks. We evaluated two framewise methods …'
