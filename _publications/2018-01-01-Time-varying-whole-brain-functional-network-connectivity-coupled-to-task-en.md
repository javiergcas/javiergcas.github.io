excerpt: 'Brain functional connectivity (FC), as measured by blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, fluctuates at the scale of 10s of seconds. It has recently been found that whole-brain dynamic FC (dFC) patterns contain sufficient information to permit identification of ongoing tasks. Here, we hypothesize that dFC patterns carry fine-grained information that allows for tracking short-term task engagement levels (i.e., 10s of seconds long). To test this hypothesis, 25 subjects were scanned continuously for 25 min while they performed and transitioned between four different tasks: working memory, visual attention, math, and rest. First, we estimated dFC patterns by using a sliding window approach. Next, we extracted two engagement-specific FC patterns representing active engagement and passive engagement by using k-means clustering. Then, we derived three metrics from whole-brain dFC patterns to track …'
