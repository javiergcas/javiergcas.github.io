excerpt: 'Studies of visual temporal frequency preference typically examine frequencies under 20 Hz and measure local activity to evaluate the sensitivity of different cortical areas to variations in temporal frequencies. Most of these studies have not attempted to map preferred temporal frequency within and across visual areas, nor have they explored in detail, stimuli at gamma frequency, which recent research suggests may have potential clinical utility. In this study, we address this gap by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure response to flickering visual stimuli varying in frequency from 1 to 40 Hz. We apply stimulation in both a block design to examine task response and a steady-state design to examine functional connectivity. We observed distinct activation patterns between 1 Hz and 40 Hz stimuli. We also found that the correlation between medial thalamus and visual cortex was modulated …'
