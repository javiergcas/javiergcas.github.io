        This study formed part of my <a href="https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI3402439/">PhD thesis</a> at <a href="www.purdue.edu">Purdue University</a>. When I joined the Talavage lab, I was provided with a challenging dataset. After nearly two years of attempting to make sense of it, I realized that the data itself was unusable, despite best efforts by everybody involved in the acquisition. This insight motivated me to explore the reliability of fMRI recordings in greater depth, culminating in this publication, where we report the test–retest reliability of an auditory sentence comprehension task. We focused on this particular cognitive domain because one of the lab’s main research lines examined the neural correlates of speech comprehension in cochlear implant users. Through this project, I was introduced to the field of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/33922/demonstrating-quality-control-qc-procedures-in-fmri/magazine">quality assurance</a>, learned multiple approaches to assessing test–retest reliability (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice-S%C3%B8rensen_coefficient">dice coefficient</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraclass_correlation"></a>intra-class correlation coefficient</a>, etc.), and gained firsthand experience with the challenges of interpreting fMRI data—specifically, how meaningful individual differences in activation patterns can persist despite high group-level reproducibility. Ultimately, our findings demonstrated that the task performed well at the group level, suggesting it could serve as a reliable protocol for future population-level studies.
