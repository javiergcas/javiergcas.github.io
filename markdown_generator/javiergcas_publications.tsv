Non-invasive measurements of brain activity with fMRI have greatly advanced our understanding of the large-scale functional organization supporting these fundamental features of brain function. Conclusions from previous resting-state fMRI investigations were based upon static descriptions of functional connectivity (FC), and only recently studies have begun to capitalize on the wealth of information contained within the temporal features of spontaneous BOLD FC. Emerging evidence suggests that dynamic FC metrics may index changes in macroscopic neural activity patterns underlying critical aspects of cognition and behavior, though limitations with regard to analysis and interpretation remain. Here, we review recent findings, methodological considerations, neural and behavioral correlates …	"R Matthew Hutchison and Thilo Womelsdorf and Elena A Allen and Peter A Bandettini and Vince D Calhoun and Maurizio Corbetta and Stefania Della Penna and Jeff H Duyn and Gary H Glover and Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and Daniel A Handwerker and Shella Keilholz and Vesa Kiviniemi and David A Leopold and Francesco de Pasquale and Olaf Sporns and Martin Walter and Catie Chang (2013).

To test several predictions that this theory makes about the neural substrates of verb meanings, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan subjects’ brains while they made semantic judgments involving five classes of verbs—specifically, Running verbs (e.g., run, jog, walk), Speaking verbs (e.g., shout, mumble, whisper), Hitting verbs (e.g., hit, poke, jab), Cutting verbs (e.g., cut, slice, hack), and Change of State verbs (e.g., shatter, smash, crack). These classes were selected because they vary with respect to the presence or absence of five distinct semantic components—specifically, ACTION, MOTION, CONTACT, CHANGE OF STATE, and TOOL USE. Based on the Simulation Framework, we hypothesized that the ACTION component …	"David Kemmerer and Javier Gonzalez Castillo and Thomas Talavage and Stephanie Patterson and Cynthia Wiley (2008).

2	2012-01-01	Periodic changes in fMRI connectivity	Neuroimage	The first two decades of brain research using fMRI have been dominated by studies that measure signal changes in response to a presented task. A rapidly increasing number of studies are showing that consistent activation maps appear by assessment of signal correlations during time periods in which the subjects were not directed to perform any specific task (i.e. “resting state correlations”). Even though neural interactions can happen on much shorter time scales, most “resting state” studies assess these temporal correlations over a period of about 5 to 10 min. Here we investigate how these temporal correlations change on a shorter time scale. We examine changes in brain correlations to the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) across a 10‐minute scan. We show: (1) fMRI correlations fluctuate over time, (2) these fluctuations can be periodic, and (3) correlations between the PCC and other brain regions fluctuate at …	"Daniel A Handwerker and Vinai Roopchansingh and Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and Peter A Bandettini (2012).
