0	2013-01-01	Dynamic functional connectivity: promise, issues, and interpretations	Neuroimage	The brain must dynamically integrate, coordinate, and respond to internal and external stimuli across multiple time scales. Non-invasive measurements of brain activity with fMRI have greatly advanced our understanding of the large-scale functional organization supporting these fundamental features of brain function. Conclusions from previous resting-state fMRI investigations were based upon static descriptions of functional connectivity (FC), and only recently studies have begun to capitalize on the wealth of information contained within the temporal features of spontaneous BOLD FC. Emerging evidence suggests that dynamic FC metrics may index changes in macroscopic neural activity patterns underlying critical aspects of cognition and behavior, though limitations with regard to analysis and interpretation remain. Here, we review recent findings, methodological considerations, neural and behavioral correlates …	"R Matthew Hutchison and Thilo Womelsdorf and Elena A Allen and Peter A Bandettini and Vince D Calhoun and Maurizio Corbetta and Stefania Della Penna and Jeff H Duyn and Gary H Glover and Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and Daniel A Handwerker and Shella Keilholz and Vesa Kiviniemi and David A Leopold and Francesco de Pasquale and Olaf Sporns and Martin Walter and Catie Chang (2013).

To test several predictions that this theory makes about the neural substrates of verb meanings, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan subjects’ brains while they made semantic judgments involving five classes of verbs—specifically, Running verbs (e.g., run, jog, walk), Speaking verbs (e.g., shout, mumble, whisper), Hitting verbs (e.g., hit, poke, jab), Cutting verbs (e.g., cut, slice, hack), and Change of State verbs (e.g., shatter, smash, crack). These classes were selected because they vary with respect to the presence or absence of five distinct semantic components—specifically, ACTION, MOTION, CONTACT, CHANGE OF STATE, and TOOL USE. Based on the Simulation Framework, we hypothesized that the ACTION component …	"David Kemmerer and Javier Gonzalez Castillo and Thomas Talavage and Stephanie Patterson and Cynthia Wiley (2008).

2	2012-01-01	Periodic changes in fMRI connectivity	Neuroimage	The first two decades of brain research using fMRI have been dominated by studies that measure signal changes in response to a presented task. A rapidly increasing number of studies are showing that consistent activation maps appear by assessment of signal correlations during time periods in which the subjects were not directed to perform any specific task (i.e. “resting state correlations”). Even though neural interactions can happen on much shorter time scales, most “resting state” studies assess these temporal correlations over a period of about 5 to 10 min. Here we investigate how these temporal correlations change on a shorter time scale. We examine changes in brain correlations to the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) across a 10‐minute scan. We show: (1) fMRI correlations fluctuate over time, (2) these fluctuations can be periodic, and (3) correlations between the PCC and other brain regions fluctuate at …	"Daniel A Handwerker and Vinai Roopchansingh and Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and Peter A Bandettini (2012).

Advanced matchmaking services require rich and flexible metadata that are not supported by currently available industry standard frameworks for e-commerce such as UDDI and ebXML. The semantic web initiative at W3C is gaining momentum and generating technologies and tools that might help bridge the gap between the current standard solutions and the requirement for advanced matchmaking services.In this paper we examine the problem of matchmaking, highlighting the features that a matchmaking service should exhibit and deriving requirements on metadata for description of services from a matchmaking point of view. We then assess a couple of standard frameworks for e-commerce against these requirements. Finally, we report on our experience of developing a semantic web based matchmaking prototype. In particular, we present our views on usefulness, adequacy, maturity and tool support of semantic web related technologies such as RDF and DAML.

5	2010-01-01	The two-level theory of verb meaning: An approach to integrating the semantics of action with the mirror neuron system	Brain and language	Verbs have two separate levels of meaning. One level reflects the uniqueness of every verb and is called the “root”. The other level consists of a more austere representation that is shared by all the verbs in a given class and is called the “event structure template”. We explore the following hypotheses about how, with specific reference to the motor features of action verbs, these two distinct levels of semantic representation might correspond to two distinct levels of the mirror neuron system. Hypothesis 1: Root-level motor features of verb meaning are partially subserved by somatotopically mapped mirror neurons in the left primary motor and/or premotor cortices. Hypothesis 2: Template-level motor features of verb meaning are partially subserved by representationally more schematic mirror neurons in Brodmann area 44 of the left inferior frontal gyrus. Evidence has been accumulating in support of the general …	"David Kemmerer and Javier Gonzalez-Castillo (2010).

Electrophysiologists report on-going neuronal firing during stimulation or task in regions beyond those of primary relationship to the perturbation. Although the biological origin of consciousness remains elusive, it is argued that it emerges from complex, continuous whole-brain neuronal collaboration. Despite converging evidence suggesting the whole brain is continuously working and adapting to anticipate and actuate in response to the environment, over the last 20 y, task-based functional MRI (fMRI) have emphasized a localizationist view of brain function, with fMRI showing only a handful of activated regions in response to task/stimulation. Here, we challenge that view with evidence that under optimal noise conditions, fMRI activations extend well beyond areas of primary relationship to the task; and blood-oxygen level …	"Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and Ziad S Saad and Daniel A Handwerker and Souheil J Inati and Noah Brenowitz and Peter A Bandettini (2012).

Based on previous evidence linking various aspects of cognition to group-level, minute-to-minute FC changes in localized connections, we hypothesized that whole-brain FC states may reflect the global, orchestrated dynamics of cognitive processing on the scale of seconds. To test this hypothesis, subjects were continuously scanned as they engaged in and transitioned between mental states dictated by tasks. FC states computed within windows as short as 22.5 s permitted robust tracking of cognition in single subjects with near perfect accuracy. Accuracy dropped markedly for subjects with the lowest task performance. Spatially restricting FC information decreased …	"Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and Colin W Hoy and Daniel A Handwerker and Meghan E Robinson and Laura C Buchanan and Ziad S Saad and Peter A Bandettini (2015).

Although the HR has been studied almost since the beginning of fMRI, we are still far from having robust methods to account for the full range of known HR variation in typical fMRI analyses. This paper reviews how the authors and others contributed to our understanding of HR variation. We present an overview of studies that describe HR variation across voxels, healthy volunteers, populations, and dietary or pharmaceutical modulations. We also describe efforts to minimize the effects of HR variation in intrasubject, group, population, and connectivity analyses and the limits of these methods.

9	2014-01-01	The spatial structure of resting state connectivity stability on the scale of minutes	Frontiers in neuroscience	Resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) connectivity patterns are not temporally stable, but fluctuate in time at scales shorter than most common rest scan durations (5 - 10 minutes). Consequently, connectivity patterns for two different portions of the same scan can differ drastically. To better characterize this temporal variability and understand how it is spatially distributed across the brain, we scanned subjects continuously for 60 minutes, at a temporal resolution of 1 second, while they rested inside the scanner. We then computed connectivity matrices between functionally-defined regions of interest for non-overlapping one minute windows, and classified connections according to their strength, polarity and variability. We found that the most stable connections correspond primarily to inter-hemispheric connections between left/right homologous ROIs. However, only 32% of all within-network connections were classified as most stable. This shows that resting stating networks have some long-term stability, but confirms the flexible configuration of these networks, particularly, those related to higher order cognitive functions. The most variable connections correspond primarily to inter-hemispheric across-network connections between non-homologous regions in occipital and frontal cortex. Finally we found a series of connections with negative average correlation, but further analyses revealed that such average negative correlations may be related to the removal of CSF signals during pre-processing. Using the same dataset, we also evaluated how similarity of within-subject whole-brain connectivity matrices changes as a function of window duration …	"Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and Daniel A Handwerker and Meghan E Robinson and Colin Weir Hoy and Laura C Buchanan and Ziad S Saad and Peter A Bandettini (2014).

When noise of physiological origin becomes the dominant noise source in fMRI timeseries, it causes a nonlinear dependence of the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR) versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that can be exploited to perform BOLD fMRI at angles well below the Ernst angle without any detrimental effect on our ability to detect sites of neuronal activation. We show, both experimentally and theoretically, that for situations where available SNR is high and physiological noise dominates over system/thermal noise, although TSNR still reaches it maximum for the Ernst angle, reduction of imaging flip angle well below this angle results in negligible loss in TSNR. Moreover, we provide a way to compute a suggested imaging flip angle, which constitutes a …	"Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and Vinai Roopchansingh and Peter A Bandettini and Jerzy Bodurka (2011).

This is particularly true for resting-state; yet, FC-dynamics have also been investigated as subjects engage on numerous tasks. It is these research efforts that constitute the core of this survey. First, empirical observations on how FC differs between task and rest—independent of temporal scale—are reviewed, as they underscore how, despite overall preservation of network topography, the brain's FC does reconfigure in systematic ways to accommodate task demands. Next, reports on the relationships between instantaneous FC and perception/performance in subsequent trials are discussed. Similarly, research where different aspects of task-concurrent FC-dynamics are explored or utilized to predict ongoing mental states are also examined.

However, it is unknown to what level human fMRI is specific and sensitive enough to reveal directional functional activity across layers. To answer this question, we developed acquisition and analysis methods for blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and cerebral-blood-volume (CBV)-based laminar fMRI and used these to discriminate four different tasks in the human motor cortex (M1). In agreement with anatomical data from animal studies, we found evidence for somatosensory and premotor input in superficial layers of M1 and for cortico-spinal motor output in deep layers. Laminar resting-state fMRI showed directional functional connectivity of M1 with somatosensory and premotor areas. Our findings demonstrate that CBV-fMRI can be used to investigate …	"Laurentius Huber and Daniel A Handwerker and David C Jangraw and Gang Chen and Andrew Hall and Carsten Stüber and Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and Dimo Ivanov and Sean Marrett and Maria Guidi and Jozien Goense and Benedikt A Poser and Peter A Bandettini (2017).

Most previous work has focused on analyzing changes in co-fluctuations between a set of brain regions over several temporal segments of the data. We argue that by collapsing data in space or time, we stand to lose useful information about the brain’s dynamical organization. Here we use Topological Data Analysis to reveal the overall organization of whole-brain activity maps at a single-participant level—as an interactive representation—without arbitrarily collapsing data in space or time. Using existing multitask fMRI datasets, with the known ground truth about the timing of transitions from one task-block to next, our approach tracks both within-and between-task transitions at a much faster time scale (~ 4–9 s) than before. The individual differences in the revealed dynamical organization predict task performance.

While in the scanner subjects were asked to listen to a series of six short everyday sentences from the CUNY sentence test. Comprehension and attention to the stimuli were monitored after each listen condition epoch by having subjects answer a series of multiple-choice questions.

Recent studies of FC dynamics, quantified by windowed correlations, provide new insights to analyze dynamic, context-dependent reconfiguration of brain networks. A set of reoccurring whole-brain connectivity patterns at rest, referred to as FC states, have been identified, hypothetically reflecting underlying cognitive processes or mental states. We posit that the mean FC information for a given subject represents a significant contribution to the group-level FC dynamics. We show that the subject-specific FC profile, termed as FC individuality, can be removed to increase sensitivity to cognitively relevant FC states. To assess the impact of the FC individuality and task-specific FC modulation on the group-level FC dynamics analysis, we generate and analyze group …	"Hua Xie and Vince D Calhoun and Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and Eswar Damaraju and Robyn Miller and Peter A Bandettini and Sunanda Mitra (2018).

Traditional treatment methods in ASD are limited, and do not address the aberrant network structure. Using real-time fMRI neurofeedback, we directly trained three brain nodes in participants with ASD, in which the aberrant connectivity has been shown to correlate with symptom severity. Desired network connectivity patterns were reinforced in real-time, without participants’ awareness of the training taking place. This training regimen produced large, significant long-term changes in correlations at the network level, and whole brain analysis revealed that the greatest changes were focused on the areas being trained. These changes were not found in the control group. Moreover, changes in ASD resting state connectivity following the training were correlated to changes in behavior, suggesting that neurofeedback can be used to directly alter complex, clinically relevant network connectivity patterns.

Lapses in sustained attention are frequent and often problematic, with conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. Recent work has had some success in finding signatures of sustained attention in whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) measures during basic tasks, but since FC can be dynamic and task-dependent, it remains unclear how fully these signatures would generalize to a more complex and naturalistic scenario. To this end, we used a previously defined whole-brain FC network – a marker of attention that was derived from a sustained attention task – to predict the ability of participants to recall material during a free-viewing reading task.

They are thought to mediate responses to sustained, unpredictable threat stimuli and phasic, predictable threat stimuli, respectively. They perform these operations largely through their interconnected networks. In two previous studies, we mapped and contrasted the resting functional connectivity networks of the BNST and CeA at 7 Tesla with high resolution. This follow-up study investigates the changes in functional connectivity of these structures during sustained anticipation of electric shock. Results show that the BNST and CeA become less strongly coupled with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), cingulate, and nucleus accumbens in shock threat relative to a safety condition.

One cognitive process, not yet investigated, is the mental representation of “Yes/No” thoughts that precede the actual overt response to a binary “Yes/No” question. In this study, we focus on examining: (1) whether spatial patterns of the hemodynamic response carry sufficient information to allow reliable decoding of “Yes/No” thoughts; and (2) whether decoding of “Yes/No” thoughts is independent of the intention to respond honestly or dishonestly. To achieve this goal, we conducted two separate experiments. Experiment 1, collected on a 3T scanner, examined the whole brain to identify regions that carry sufficient information to permit significantly above-chance prediction of “Yes/No” thoughts at the group level.

Here, we investigate the biological significance of such widespread activations. First, the relationship between activation extent and task demands was investigated by varying cognitive load across participants. Second, the tissue specificity of responses was probed using the better BOLD signal localization capabilities of a 7T scanner. Finally, the spatial distribution of 3 primary response types—namely positively sustained (pSUS), negatively sustained (nSUS), and transient—was evaluated using a newly defined voxel-wise waveshape index that permits separation of responses based on their temporal signature.

The speech processor, in conjunction with isolating insert earphones and a microphone to capture environment sounds, was worn by participants over a two week chronic exposure period. fMRI and behavioral speech comprehension testing were conducted before and after this two week period. After using the simulator each day for 2 h, participants significantly improved in word and sentence recognition scores. fMRI shows that these improvements came accompanied by changes in patterns of neuronal activation. In particular, we found additional recruitment of visual, motor, and working memory areas after the perceptual training period. These findings suggest that the human …	"Christopher J Smalt and Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and Thomas M Talavage and David B Pisoni and Mario A Svirsky (2013).

Previous studies have demonstrated that this noise can induce unwanted neuronal responses that can mask stimulus-induced responses. Similarly, activation accumulated over multiple stimuli has been demonstrated to elevate the baseline, thus reducing the dynamic range available for subsequent responses. To best evaluate responses to auditory stimuli, it is necessary to account for the presence of all recent acoustic stimulation, beginning with an understanding of the attenuating effects brought about by interaction between and among induced unwanted neuronal responses, and responses to desired auditory stimuli.

Nine subjects underwent fMRI scanning where they performed a sequential, oppositional finger-tapping task. The first five runs were conducted with the subject's head remaining stable inside the head coil. Following this, four more runs were collected after the subject removed and replaced his/her head inside the head coil before each run. The coefficient of variation was calculated for four metrics: the distance from the anterior commisure to the center of mass of sensorimotor activation, maximum t-statistic, activation volume, and average percent signal change.

Within-subject variance was segregated into four primary components: variance across-sessions, variance across-runs within a session, variance across-blocks within a run, and residual measurement/modeling error. Our results reveal inhomogeneous and distinct spatial distributions of these variance components across significantly active voxels in grey matter.

Numerous methodologies have been proposed to characterize dFC during rest and task, but few studies have compared them in terms of their efficacy to capture behavioral and clinically relevant dynamics. This is mostly due to lack of a well-defined ground truth, especially for rest scans. In this study, with a multitask dataset (rest, memory, video, and math) serving as ground truth, we investigated the efficacy of several dFC estimation techniques at capturing cognitively relevant dFC modulation induced by external tasks.

It has recently been found that whole-brain dynamic FC (dFC) patterns contain sufficient information to permit identification of ongoing tasks. Here, we hypothesize that dFC patterns carry fine-grained information that allows for tracking short-term task engagement levels (i.e., 10s of seconds long). To test this hypothesis, 25 subjects were scanned continuously for 25 min while they performed and transitioned between four different tasks: working memory, visual attention, math, and rest. First, we estimated dFC patterns by using a sliding window approach. Next, we extracted two engagement-specific FC patterns representing active engagement and passive engagement by using k-means clustering. Then, we derived three metrics from whole-brain dFC patterns to track …	"Hua Xie and Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and Daniel A Handwerker and Peter A Bandettini and Vince D Calhoun and Gang Chen and Eswar Damaraju and Xiangyu Liu and Sunanda Mitra (2018).

34	2017-01-01	Introducing alternative-based thresholding for defining functional regions of interest in fMRI	Frontiers in neuroscience	In fMRI research, one often aims to examine activation in specific functional regions of interest (fROIs). Current statistical methods tend to localize fROIs inconsistently, focusing on avoiding detection of false activation. Not missing true activation is however equally important in this context. In this study, we explored the potential of an alternative-based thresholding (ABT) procedure, where evidence against the null hypothesis of no effect and evidence against a prespecified alternative hypothesis is measured to control both false positives and false negatives directly. The procedure was validated in the context of localizer tasks on simulated brain images and using a real data set of 100 runs per subject. Voxels categorized as active with ABT can be confidently included in the definition of the fROI, while inactive voxels can be confidently excluded. Additionally, the ABT method complements classic null hypothesis significance testing with valuable information by making a distinction between voxels that show evidence against both the null and alternative and voxels for which the alternative hypothesis cannot be rejected despite lack of evidence against the null.

In order to expand the range of questions which can be addressed with this tool however, new neurofeedback methods must be developed, going beyond feedback of activations in a single region. These new methods, several of which have already been proposed, are by their nature complex, involving many possible parameters.

38	2019-01-01	Imaging the spontaneous flow of thought: Distinct periods of cognition contribute to dynamic functional connectivity during rest	bioRxiv	Brain functional connectivity (FC) changes have been measured across seconds using fMRI. This is true for both rest and task scenarios. Moreover, it is well accepted that task engagement alters FC, and that dynamic estimates of FC during and before task events can help predict their nature and performance. Yet, when it comes to dynamic FC (dFC) during rest, there is no consensus about its origin or significance. Some argue that rest dFC reflects fluctuations in on-going cognition, or is a manifestation of intrinsic brain maintenance mechanisms, which could have predictive clinical value. Conversely, others have concluded that rest dFC is mostly the result of sampling variability, head motion or fluctuating sleep states. Here, we present novel analyses suggesting that rest dFC is influenced by short periods of distinct mental processing, and that the cognitive nature of such mental processes can be inferred blindly from the data. As such, several different behaviorally relevant whole-brain FC configurations may occur during a single rest scan even when subjects were continuously awake and displayed minimal motion. In addition, using low dimensional embeddings as visualization aids, we show how FC states (commonly used to summarize and interpret resting dFC) can accurately and robustly reveal periods of externally imposed tasks; however, they may be less effective in capturing periods of distinct cognition during rest.

40	2013-01-01	Detection of consistent cognitive processing at the single subject level using whole-brain fMRI Connectivity	Presentation at Soc Neurosci, San Diego (CA)	Recent studies have demonstrated that resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity patterns are dynamic in nature; and that significant changes in the strength and distribution of connections occur as scanning progresses [1, 2, 3]. Consequently, connectivity patterns obtained using one portion of a scan (eg, first 2 mins) may differ greatly from patterns observed using the rest of the data or when the whole scan is used at once. In particular, there are three main observations reported with respect to rs-fMRI connectivity dynamics so far:(1) rs-fMRI connectivity changes substantially in the scale of seconds to minutes [1];(2) changes occur both during awake and anesthetized conditions [3]; and (3) a certain level of recurrent structure can be found, with a limited set of connectivity configurations (functional connectivity states; FC states) being stable for short durations, and recurring in time and across subjects [4]. These observations pose important questions regarding the biological significance and interpretation of rs-fMRI dynamics at these shorter time scales.Of particular interest is the potential relationship between FC states and cognition. It has been previously shown that a classifier could differentiate between four different cognitive states on the basis of whole-brain connectivity [5]. Accuracies as high as 80% were reported for time windows as short at 60 s. Nonetheless, the methods described in that work are not suitable for evaluating the relationship between FC and cognitive state in rs-fMRI due to the need for:(1) a training dataset,(2) a-priori information about informative connections, and a (3) well-defined/limited search domain of cognitive states …	"Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and C Hoy and D Handwerker and M Robinson and P Bandettini (2013).

One of the more challenging aspects of the use of this technique is the application to studies involving acoustic stimulation, given that the measurement process generates acoustic noise of high intensity that can mask or otherwise impede perception and comprehension of a desired auditory stimulus. Advances in attenuation, acquisition strategies and experimental design have enhanced the use of fMRI in this context, with recent advances in active noise cancellation and our understanding of the fMRI-assessed hemodynamic response laying a framework for continued improvement.

Most of these studies have not attempted to map preferred temporal frequency within and across visual areas, nor have they explored in detail, stimuli at gamma frequency, which recent research suggests may have potential clinical utility. In this study, we address this gap by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure response to flickering visual stimuli varying in frequency from 1 to 40 Hz.

This increase in blood flow is slow and highly variable and shows a considerable spatial heterogeneity.

46	2009-01-01	Application of functional magnetic resonance imaging to the study of language		Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a powerful neuroimaging technique that allows in-vivo imaging of brain function using local changes in blood oxygenation levels (BOLD) as an intrinsic metabolic marker of neural activity. This dissertation presents a series of fMRI studies designed to advance our understanding of the neural correlates of language processing, focusing on three important aspects:(1) neural correlates of pre-lexical analysis of normal and spectrally degraded speech—eg, cochlear implant speech;(2) neural correlates of conceptual representations of action verbs; and (3) design of robust, highly reliable fMRI experimental protocols suitable for longitudinal and clinical studies of speech function.^ The first study focused on understanding the neural correlates of adaptation to acoustic simulations of spectrally degraded speech that mimics what cochlear implant (CI) users perceive through their implants. Six normal hearing subjects underwent fifteen sessions of training with degraded speech produced using an acoustic CI simulator [2]. Two fMRI imaging sessions were conducted, one prior and one subsequent to training. During each imaging session subjects were presented with both normal and degraded speech utterances while performing a non-linguistic discrimination task. It was found that training in degraded speech perception was associated with increased recruitment of the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 46), and the left inferior frontal junction, as well as reduced activity within a region in the posterior Sylvian fissure at the parietal-temporal boundary.^ In respect to the …	"Javier Gonzalez Castillo (2009).

This ability–termed event segmentation—helps humans analyze, memorize, and compare events that occur around them in order to survive. Individuated events can also be communicated to others in predicative units: sentences. Each well-formed Sentence in human languages is constructed around a predicate, typically expressed by a verb. Verbs across languages parse and formulate observable events in a logically restricted fashion (eg, Son and Cole 2008; Borer 1994; Ritter and Rosen 1998; Davis and Demidarche 2000; Hale and Keyser 1993; Van Valin 2007). Linguists have known for a long time that semantic features of verbs can influence the grammar of the sentence, like the number of arguments, or the typically used tense.
